## 📚 Quick Reference

### Before You Start:
```bash
# Check if Git is installed
git --version

# Should see something like: git version 2.33.0
```

### During Deployment:
```bash
# All the commands you'll need:
git init                    # One time only
git config --global ...     # One time only
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git remote add hf ...       # One time only
git push hf main            # Every update
```

### After Deployment:
```bash
# To update your app:
git add .
git commit -m "changes"
git push hf main
# Wait 2-5 minutes for rebuild
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### DO:
✅ Keep API keys secret (use Space Secrets, not .env)
✅ Test locally first (optional but recommended)
✅ Read the error logs if something fails
✅ Monitor your Space after deployment

### DON'T:
❌ Commit `.env` file to git (.gitignore prevents this)
❌ Share your API keys in messages
❌ Modify Dockerfile unless you know Docker
❌ Use old OpenAI API format (I updated it for you!)
