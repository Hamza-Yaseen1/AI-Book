# Lesson 1: Introduction to Physical AI

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what Physical AI is and its core principles
- Explore the relationship between AI and physical systems
- Identify common applications of Physical AI in real-world scenarios

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to the integration of artificial intelligence algorithms with physical systems and hardware. Unlike traditional AI that operates primarily in digital environments, Physical AI bridges the gap between digital intelligence and the physical world.

### Core Principles

1. **Sensing**: Gathering information from the physical environment through sensors
2. **Processing**: Using AI algorithms to interpret sensor data and make decisions
3. **Actuation**: Taking physical actions based on AI decisions

### Applications

Physical AI is used in various domains:
- Robotics and automation
- Smart home systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Industrial manufacturing
- Healthcare devices

## Hands-On Exercise

For this lesson, we'll start with a simple Physical AI concept using a Raspberry Pi and basic sensors.

### Required Materials
- Raspberry Pi (any model with GPIO pins)
- Breadboard
- Jumper wires
- Basic sensors (temperature, light, or motion)

### Implementation Steps

1. Set up your Raspberry Pi with the necessary libraries
2. Connect a sensor to your Raspberry Pi
3. Write a simple Python script to read sensor data
4. Process the data to make a simple decision
5. Output the result (LED, display, etc.)

### Code Example

We've provided a complete example that demonstrates the basic Physical AI concepts covered in this lesson. You can find the code in our examples directory:

[Download Lesson 1 Example Code](/examples/lesson-1-basic-sensor.py)

To run the example:
```bash
# Navigate to the physical-ai directory
cd physical-ai

# Run the example (simulated version)
python static/examples/lesson-1-basic-sensor.py
```

## Summary

This lesson introduced you to the fundamental concepts of Physical AI. In the next lesson, we'll build a simple Physical AI system from scratch.

### Exercises

1. Research three different Physical AI applications in industries that interest you
2. Identify the sensing, processing, and actuation components in each application
3. Think about how you might apply Physical AI concepts to solve a problem in your daily life
